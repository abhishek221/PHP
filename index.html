        <h2 style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">HTML for absolute Beginners</h2>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;font-size:large;">While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML using a lot of mind-boggling theory, this tutorial will instead <mark><b>focus on giving you the practical skills to build your first site.</b></mark><br>

            The aim is to show you ‘how’ to create your first web page without spending the entire tutorial <b>focusing too much on the “why.”</b><br>
            
            By the end of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a basic website and we hope that this will inspire you to delve further into the world of HTML using our follow-on guides.

        <p style="font-family: monospace;font-size:large;">Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.<br>

            <br><mark><b>HTML is the language in which most websites are written.</b></mark> HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.<br>
            
            The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.
